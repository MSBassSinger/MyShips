# MyShips
Xamarin Forms simple code example.

This sample prograam was written in about 4 hours, with an additional hour or so spent 
adding word wrap and image sizing.  It shows images of ships and duty stations I served
on in the US Navy.

The images were acquired beforehand.  This is an abbreviated example to show what I could 
do in Xamarin Forms given a short time, to illustrate that I could do more complex 
Xamarin Forms projects given more time.

The aspp was recently updatyed in about 6 hours to targte Xamarin Forms 4.8
