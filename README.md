# MyShips
Xamarin Forms simple code example.

This sample prograam was written in about 4 hours, with an additional hour or so spent adding word wrap and image sizing. It shows images of ships and duty stations I served on in the US Navy.

The images were acquired beforehand.  This is an abbreviated example to show what I could 
do in Xamarin Forms given a short time, to illustrate that I could do more complex 
Xamarin Forms projects given more time.

The aspp was updated in about 6 hours to target Xamarin Forms 4.8, then lately a couple of hours 
to Xamarin.Forms 5.0.
